## GACS Workshop - Day 1

SUB Goettingen

### Johannes Keizer presentation [see @@@]

__Johannes__: Slides cleared with Stan and Martin.  What is the goal of the
entire enterprise?  Serves a purpose.  Diagram from Data Ecosystem paper
published with Syngenta: one way to show data world.  [Continuum from closed 
to open data.]  Data is not only numbers.  Also textual info. Encoded, read 
by machines.  Must serve a broad spectrum of needs. Images. Geo-spatial. 
Videos. Anything that can be digitized.

FAIR (acronym) - endorsed in G20 meeting. European Commission decided that 
"scientific outputs" need to be FAIR
  Findable
  Accessible 
  Interoperable
  Reusable
New mantra how data needs to be encoded managed, served.  To have FAIR data, 
need infrastructure. Or some prefer: "ecosystem". (As a biologist, reluctant
to use this, but okay.)  Prefer plural: "infrastructures" because it will not 
be one big system.

[Slide] AgInfra project. Semantics was always one of the big elements. 
Obviously not the only.  Need data processing tools, storage, APIs.  Was 
done in big days of LOD, hype - we said we need machinery to make data 
machine-readable, triplifying to use in infrastructure.  

Semantics serves many purposes.  Put into this world 17-18 years ago -
semantics came from library world. Mostly thesauri.  Also organization of
information.  Need entity lists.  Sometimes hidden entities in thesauri.
Cities. Chemical substances. But difference between seeing something as entity
or concept.  Code lists for statistical classifications.  Knowledge-driven 
apps need ontologies.  Text and data mining also ontologies. Colleagues at 
NAL pointed me that machine learning systems, automatic indexing systems - 
need these elements of semantics to do their job.

[Slide] Isolated semantics - stand-alone, silos, may be semantic but not 
solving interoperability problem.

Remember Ferdinando in Chania: "We need a global authority file for concepts
that are used for ontology building."  So what brought together concept scheme
and ontology building.  Building ontology: classes, sub-classes, but they are
not looking to existing vocabularies - mostly not.

[Final slide] If you have to map ontologies, this is already by itself a big
problem because you have to create equivalences. People have worked on this
with variable success.  But if you think about an ongoing mapping process, this
is not manageable.  Because exponential formula - you have to map always more.
If you refer to reference vocabulary.  This is maybe a naive view of the
problem.  Something that links different ontologies together because they
refer, with some equivalence, to a common concept vocabulary, called here GACS.

Odile, head of info services at INRA, in her email response to Osma qstnnr: "We
have to answer question what GACS will be: the core of interoperability for
data ecosystem, or the core thesaurus of bibliographic databases...?" We have
to agree on what we want to achieve. Alot of discussions change if we change
goal.  Question mark in headline, because putting out for discussion.  We need
something that is a common reference point, where partners take concepts and
relationships, create a new specialized KOS.  If they create new, commonly
important concepts, they give them back into the common shared pool, and they
create specialized KOS - taxonomies, whatever.

For me, GACS is more a functional thing than a physical entity. I don't think 
all entity lists would come into such a global facility because others are 
doing this for geonames, etc. But methodology of using something like central 
authority file, if there is a URI for 'iron', might get ontology of melting 
points, then you should at least refer to existing URIs.

This is all.  My ambition: GACS is not just about getting together three 
thesauri, which by itself is an achievement, but getting broader in giving 
some kind of interoperability basis for all the work in different semantic 
systems.  This is what I want to discuss here, because broadening to broader
spectrum of people interested in topic - people who need these things we are 
doing.

__Elizabeth__: Did not mention multilingual nature of GACS.

__Johannes__: Has become something by default. Modeling issues, because terms
are not simply labels, but relationships between them.  Could be well-handled
at GACS level and inherited by systems that use GACS structures.  My idea: as
much inheritance as possible, but not more. Because if you over-commit and 
overspecialize in something that should be of common use, then it is no longer 
of common use.  This is also why this should always stay in SKOS and not in a 
formal ontology.  

__Derek__: Johannes, you have data services. Importance of data services 
increases the greater the ambition for GACS.  If it is the glue that allows 
interoperability to happen, then there needs to be a certain reliability 
around data services.  How does that contrast with what happened before with 
AGROVOC, in terms of commitment of organizations and partners?

__Johannes__: I think you are touching on governance issue. Should discuss.
In structure of workshop prepared by WG.  But reliability is really important.
But AGROVOC has been reliable, quite good, for 18 years.

__Derek__: The players in the space - what their commitment is.

__Johannes__: Players in data ecosystem have interest in keeping reliable.
Not resolvable at the level of semantics only.

__Dean__: Johannes, given that AGROVOC has been around, what is the need 
for GACS?

__Johannes__: AGROVOC is around for 35 years. Created in 1980s with grant 
from European Commission, to serve Agris database.  CAB Thesaurus also 1980s 
or 1990s. NALT a bit newer. Same goal. Three years ago, Simon, Martin, 
and I met at conference in Ithaca and decided we needed to do something 
more. Birth of GACS project.
