### Lisette Meij presents LandVoc use case [@@@]

__Lisette__: LandVoc, of Land Portal, is within AGROVOC, and is basically a
list of land-related terms in AGROVOC -- about 270 terms.  And we enrich that
with help of partners.  If something is missing, or if they describe things
differently, to add synonyms, because these are very global vocabularies and we
want it to be used more widely.  We ask them to add translations.  It is a
separate land term scheme within AGROVOC at the moment, and we want to
basically [encourage] the land sector to use a standard, because there
basically is no standard within the land sector at the moment.  The knowledge
of standards is very low.  Alot have free tagging systems or don't even use
metadata at all.  Some just want to have something they are work with.  So
that's why we decided to develop LandVoc within AGROVOC.  We use it currently
as the backbone of our website -- everything is structured according to
LandVoc.  But we want it to be a product that can be used by the wider land
governance community.  We are waiting for the latest release of AGROVOC for the 
land term scheme to be there as well.  And then, we are following initiatives 
that are trying to frame land terms and giving them definitions.  We're trying 
to add that back into the land terms schemes as well, so these attempts to make 
glossaries -- we'll make an added value by making it a standard, in RDF vocabularies.
We're thinking of establishing a task force with experts can help us editorialize 
this vocabulary.  Were the coordinators but we're not terminology experts, so 
we'll guard these 270 terms and make sure that additions that the global partners 
suggest, that they add value and that it's consistent.  We use LandVoc for all 
data types on the Land Portal.  Statistical indicators: we add the tags to it.
We do it for geographic data. For everyone on Land Portal - structured according 
to LandVoc.  There's not a time variable; it is all topical.  We don't use 
geographical terms, never used FAO GPO for that.  

__Lisette__: Completely exists within AGROVOC.  We queried for a manual
selection of land-related terms.  We ended up with 270 concepts that are all
over the place.  Because if you extract it from AGROVOC -- in their hierarchy,
it just becomes a scrambled thing.  Sometimes we have BT/NT relationships where
we imported both the parent and child term from AGROVOC, but often it's not.
So we have alot of topical concepts and a couple of hierarchies here and there.
That's what it is now.  We want to build a hierarchy within that -- build more
relationships. With 270 terms its very doable.  We have a collaborative process 
to determine top-level concepts. That is -- those don't fit within AGROVOC, 
so we have to figure out a way to build that out because it's not appropriate 
for those to have AGROVOC URIs.  

__Lisette__: Re: governance.  We are the coordinators, so we will have a task 
force of terminology experts looking at the content.  What we want for the future 
is to be as independent as possible, because land is very controversial.  To get 
a widely used tool or standard is incredibly difficult because people will 
contest everything they see.  So we need to be able to make compromises, which 
linguistically or the hierarchy might not be the best way to go.  We need to 
be able to do that for it to be a tool that is widely used.  We have to have 
room to make those compromises, to make sure that it can be used.  For example, 
we want to be able to put in more than one definition per term.  We had this 
discussion last night: "land ownership" -- it can mean so many different things,
it depends on the legal system you are working in.  It's very broad.  So we 
need to be able to input more things in that.  That's an editorial control that 
we need for this to be a good tool for the land governance community.

__Lisette__: LandVoc is currently MIT-licensed.  Can use; just need to attribute 
to AGROVOC and Land Portal.  Our objective is to make sure this is a tool everyone 
can use in the land sector.  We see there is a clear gap we can fill -- a clear 
need for this.  This can make a big difference.  For it to be widely used, we 
can't have it saying that this is Land Portal's vocabulary, we need it to be a 
collaborative process.  So we're looking for terminology experts that have written 
about land and worked on land extensively, from different sectors, who speak 
different languages, and who understand the controversy of this subject, so that 
it can be properly monitored.  We would be the technical expertise for managing 
such a vocabulary (thesaurus).  We won't interfere with the substantive element.

__Lisette__: We have started to build a strategy around this.  "Worst-case"
scenario -- not really worst -- it would stay within AGROVOC.  We would build 
a hierarchy up until a certain and then move to our own content management 
system for the top level, and connect it like that, because AGROVOC is so 
broad, it doesn't matter, even though it is an agriculture vocabulary, we can 
add urban terms to it, because it fits into AGROVOC anyway.  So that's an 
opportunity.  And then we want to build some more capacity building around it.
Awareness raising -- first step, to get people to know what a standard is and 
how to use and advantage of using it.  Then word gets around, get people to 
use it more and understand it.  

__Lisette__: Ideal scenario: our own vocabulary, managed completely by 
ourselves, with our namespace.  But is that the ideal scenario for the land 
sector?  Probably not, because we don't have the same stability, or the 
same appearance of stability, as an AGROVOC URI would have.  We want to make 
webinars, tutorials, to get people to learn about standards because in the 
GODAN Action partnership we did this Gap Analysis to see the use of standards
and they are not used at all -- it was kind of shocking to see the big gap 
that's there.  We're definitely serving the community by starting this 
initiative.  Questions?

__Dean__: We had a discussion here yesterday about the democratization of 
GACS -- the question "is there a core" or not?  What does it mean to be 
adding things on, who can add them in?  And it sounds like your situation is 
exactly an example of the kind of democratization we were talking about.
So it would be worth our while to think about your organization and alot 
of things you are saying, we don't have the [] clout to make our own 
vocabulary, but AGROVOC does.  Or is it GACS?  How do you think you relate 
to GACS?  Does everything you say about AGROVOC apply to GACS?

__Lisette__: Depends on how many of the land-related terms have gone into 
GACS.  We are very curious.

__Osma__: Couldn't do because I couldn't find the data; but she promised to
send it.  In fact, if you send it now... it doesn't take long.

__Lisette__: I can imagine that would be both GACS Core, as it was presented
yesterday, and the Extension, and that would be then AGROVOC.   That's also 
why we're here, because we're very curious to see what GACS can do for us, 
where maybe there are limitations within AGROVOC.  

__Sujata__: What kind of land terms?

__Lisette__: Land governance in the broadest sense of the word.  Land tenure-related, 
but alot of government policy.  Alot of land management terms.  Also urban planning.
Very broad.  Everything that is about land.  That's why it fits into AGROVOC well, 
because agriculture is so related to land.  But it would go beyond that also. 

__Elizabeth__: There is a section that is of high interest for our institution, 
working in administration: you have "land use management and investment".  So the 
top terms could be useful for us.  "Land degradation".  So for now, those terms 
have an AGROVOC URI.  But if you decide to move away, because you decide you need 
a richer structure, what would be the URI to use?  If we use your terms to annotate 
our datasets.

__Lisette__: Not sure yet.  For the Land Portal, might be interesting to have our 
own namespace, but for it to be used in the land sector and beyond it might not be
the most obvious things.  All these lower-level concepts have AGROVOC URIs, so 
"land degradation" is in AGROVOC.  "Land use management and investment" is an 
overarching category that we have, that was established in our collaborative 
process, and that only has a Land Portal URI at the moment.  So what you see there 
on the page is the fixed relationships that we made between those concepts that, 
if a resource were tagged with that concept, it would always fall under that 
overarching category.  It isn't always the case.

__Elizabeth__: Interesting because when you click on that term there is an 
associated document.  

__Lisette__: So it's fully integrated into the context. 

__Elizabeth__: So if the strategy is not clear, would GACS be a tool, a hub?
For example, for Bioversity, we want to annotate our data, of our land restoration 
project, and we would need terms that have been added by Land Portal, so it 
could be GACS, the hub, leading us to the terms of LandVoc, even if some of the 
terms are outside GACS, or the Core.  It's an example of a vocabulary that has 
maybe become richer than what it is in AGROVOC, and may go bigger than AGROVOC.
So would we need to follow those terms where they go and keep a stable URI 
when we annotate?

__Tom__: Several aspects are interesting: to understand the users better.  I read 
the gap analysis, which had alot to do with vocabularies being used to structure 
portals.  When you talk about capacity building, do you mean for portal building? 
What sort of people do you want to reach?

__Lisette__: Land Portal primarily targets intermediaries, as a global platform 
dealing with alot of very local issues -- we try to pull that information online.
Our partnerships are country- or regional-level.  Organizations that produce 
information and share it online -- all those websites are the people we target.
Right now we target policy makers -- people that have the power to determine 
whether they are going open-data.  Next step would be their webmasters and their 
librarians, who are dealing with this more hands-on.  But primarily intermediaries 
-- people who have websites and publish the information.

__Tom__: Other aspect: Are you using AGROVOC concepts unchanged, or are you 
enriching them with things like definitions?  Or taking "as is" and packaging 
them in a different way? 

__Lisette__: Process started awhile back, before I was with the Land Portal.
At the time, AGROVOC had about 20 land-related terms.  Gerard [sipas], very
renowned, added alot of terms.  Now, initiative by prominent global land
organizations called Global Land Indicator Initiative, which was really into
the SCGs and the land indicator.  They wanted to frame the debate.  Had a list
of terms with definitions.  Was a very long, elaborate process.  We also added
those to AGROVOC as synonyms -- altLabel to terms already there.  We are adding
translations.  Great collaboration in the Mekhong region, so translated all 270
terms into Khmer, Thai, Vietnamese.  Also definitions.  That way, we're
enriching both -- back to AGROVOC and to the land term scheme as well.   That's
a continuous thing.  We consider work in progress -- never going to be
"finished".

__Derek__: How does something officially become an AGROVOC term when it is 
donated in that way?  New terms being contributed by external agency.  What's 
the process?  Say a hundred terms are emailed to you.

__Caterina__: Platform-wise, there is an application.  It works -- they have
something in mind, proposals -- originally there was a list coming from a
presentation by Gerard.  We have some guidelines to guide editors in
understanding what to.  AGROVOC started as something edited by thesauri
experts, and now the editing is distributed to domain experts.  The transition
implies that many ideas about what the hierarchy is... -- we tried to condense
everything into guidelines.  They read the guidelines, make a proposal, we
check whether it is appropriate, then things go into VocBench.  So the main
issues are: if they have something very complex in mind -- "land property
rights" -- this is not even the most complex -- but quite typical.  "Property
right" could already be [in AGROVOC].  So one approach could be to not add any,
just combine at indexing.  And the other approach is to say: "no I actually
want to have this, because it's important".  So there was quite some
conversations on this type of topics and on the use of NT/BT.  Relations: they
did not use RT very much, probably not at all.  There is always a great deal of
rule of thumb.

__Lisette__: For translations, we sent an Excel sheet to Caterina.  We have an
ontology editor in VocBench, so with a colleague I would try to figure out
where to nest particular terms, then we would input, then we would have
discussions with Caterina and colleagues to figure out if this was the right
place. 

__Caterina__: At the beginning, said that this resource would be used for 
tagging many different types of data.  

__Lisette__: It's integrated into our CMS, so we use it to tag any kind of 
data that is on the Land Portal. 

__Caterina__: You might be affected by how GACS develops.  

__Lisette__: [Just sent data to Osma.]  Will be very curious to see how many 
of the terms are in GACS Core.

__Elizabeth__: So Land Portal is one of your use cases for explaining AGROVOC.
Have you already decided how you will get the feedback reported, organized, 
and useful for other use cases?  So that we know what issues they faced?
Because if you have another community coming to you saying, okay, we would 
like to expand AGROVOC to another domain, so they know the path followed by 
Land Portal -- could be useful to document it.

__Tom__: I can think of ways to more systematically collect information from 
potential partners about how they would foresee interacting with GACS, reusing 
it, etc.  Partly now a question of funding.  We do not have funding.  But it 
wouldn't take much funding.  

__Elizabeth__: It would support proposal-writing.

__Johannes__: If we look at this collaboration AGROVOC/Land Portal, we see also
the restrictions of the traditional thesaurus, as it is done.  It is not _so_
traditional, but if we look at the _content_ -- as a content it _is_ a
traditional thesaurus.  It is so artificial, this hierarchy that has been put
on AGROVOC, as a kind of ontological hierarchy -- organisms, products -- it
looks funny.  If you really look to the content, what it is, there are some
really funny things, because it was not constructed systematically.  It grew: a
tree here, a shrub there, and sometimes the trees were connected.  And if you
add something, it's already difficult.  So the idea that this all has to be
modularized, with an upper level and specialized vocabulary levels, we have
since fifteen years.  We never had the intellectual capacity and the financial
capacity to do so.  And what I see in the GACS is really this modularization
process that -- if there is something like Land Portal, they take the upper
level of things that are of general importance to people who are talking about
Land Use and Land Rights. But then they create the Land Vocabulary.  Then,
where I'm unsure: what is the relationship between what we call GACS, and what
is a specific land vocabulary?  I could imagine that you have an ontology --
because I can imagine that the Land Portal at some point needs an ontology to
drive the application, because it is a very specialized, interesting
application -- but then you publish a SKOS vocabulary of your concepts as part
of the GACS so that others, who want to do similar work: they cannot use the
ontology, because the ontology is fine-tuned on this application.  But they can
use the SKOS vocabulary.  And this for me would be GACS.  Because otherwise,
what has happened, this monster becomes always more monster, like AGROVOC, you
are always adding, adding, adding there and it becomes always more difficult
also to use.  

__Osma__: [Has the results.] 94 of the 270 LandVoc concepts are in GACS, and a 
further 20 or 22 have some sort of relationship -- one third.

__Lisette__: More than I expected.

__Tom__: What relationship would you propose between GACS and Land Portal?
Would all of those things go into GACS?

__Johannes__: This is now purely definition -- what do you want to define 
as GACS?  What do you define as something else?  And I am completely open. 
When I came here, in my head, I had a dichotomous view of what we are going 
in Agrisemantics: one is GACS, on one side, and on the other side are 
specialized KOS.  Everything that is reusable would be GACS.  So if you do 
a specialized ontology, if you find the concepts that you need for your 
classes in GACS, you use them, declaring them sameAs or exactMatch.  If 
you do something bigger and you create a new vocabulary, you publish this 
SKOS vocabulary as a part of GACS.  But you can do this in many different 
ways; you can also name things in many different ways.  What for me is 
bottom line is that the area of easily available semantic material, to 
construct your own KOSes, gets bigger.  And is not as complicated as it is 
at the moment.  Reuse of CAT Thesaurus is complicated -- it's not easy. 
We have tried this.  Reuse of AGROVOC can be a nightmare.  Reuse of CAT 
Thesaurus is so much easier because it was somewhat more... -- but also 
this thesaurus has been done for a specific purpose of the needs of the 
National Agricultural Library. And what I need is something... -- for 
me the GACS is something that can also serve for specific purposes -- 
they are very limited -- so if you only want to index something, or 
simply use Web services, an API on GACS, use the access to GACS concepts.
As I said, these are only weak ideas of the direction, I don't want to say 
that I know what have to do.

__Caterina__: Often I'm not sure if we are talking about GACS as the 
initiative or GACS as GACS Core.

__Derek__: GACS Beta.  So does 95% of this room -- the GACS Beta not being GACS
-- because we don't actually have a definition.

__Tom__: GACS says it's a concept scheme.  I think that should be fairly 
clear.  But then there's the GACS community, the initiative, the people 
who are working on GACS.  And then there's Agrisemantics.  We still need 
to come back to those, maybe tomorrow after we have heard more use cases.
I think we're actually circling around the same issues but are not quite 
settled on how to call things, which is.

__Dean__: Yesterday we had an interesting discussion about namespaces, 
bringing up a challenge which at least I didn't think of yesterday.  It 
sounds like you have some concepts in LandVoc that are in AGROVOC and 
let's imagine that they are in GACS, for the sake of argument.  You have 
others that you use to organize them, because the land ones aren't really
fully connected inside of AGROVOC, so when you are done, you now have an 
internally consistent, coherent vocabulary with some things in one 
namespace and some in another.  And so yesterday we were talking about 
various options -- should we bring this into GACS, would we change the 
namespaces, or not change the namespaces?  It never occurred to me that 
we actually might have a mixture of namespaces even in the contribution.
The contribution would have its namespace and GACS would have its.  And 
we were just thinking about that.  Now the contribution itself is 
hetergeneous.  And I don't know what to say about that.

__Tom__: That was, for me, part of the rationale for thinking about the 
notion of a GACS extension.  So you can think of GACS as being a large, 
even amorphone vocabulary, and then you have a more highly curated part 
called the Core, which has stricter rules.  And things can move back and 
forth, in and out of the Core, without changing their URIs.  So everything 
would be GACS, but only some of them would be inScheme for GACS Core.  

__Dean__: In terms of namespaces, those would all have a GACS namespace?

__Tom__: Yes.

__Dean__: So if something drifts in and out of the Core, it better not 
change its namespace.  

__Tom__: Exactly.

__Dean__: So once it's in the core, it will get that core namespace...?

__Tom__: No, because the Core would not be a separate namespace.  I think 
it is a mistake to reflect status in a URI.

__Dean__: Fair enough.  So [Lisette] develops new terms for LandVoc, she 
would need to put them into the GACS namespace. 

__Tom__: She could, yes.

__Dean__: But when? While she's developing?  That doesn't seem right. 
Or when it's accepted as an extension, you change them?  That was one of 
the options we discussed yesterday.

__Tom__: It's hard for me to picturing scaling an approval process for 
extensions, just because they might go off in many directions.  But in 
theory, the idea of an extension was that you could have a LandVoc extension 
and then -- I don't want to get too deeply into policy issues that we would 
at some point need to decide -- but if the GACS community, its goverance, 
if it said LandVoc has an extension of GACS, then it could do within that 
extension whatever it wanted.  It would be difficult to imagine having any 
sort of tight control over that.  There could be simple ground rules, like:
The URIs will not go away.  Once coined in that namespace, will not actually
disappear.  That was the rationale.  Also, the notion of an extension -- 
it gives a place to put things to take them out of the core.  To make the 
core tighter.

__Lisette__: If we were a use case, and some of our terms would now be in 
the core, because land is such a controversial subject, and we not want to 
have those strict rules to abide by, that core would have, for us it would 
make sense to pull it into the extension.  But then aren't you losing some 
critical terms in your GACS Core?

__Johannes__: I want to get rid of this word "extension" as quick as possible!
Because "extension" means there is something that is the Core, and the rest are
extensions.  The commodity list, as used by FAOSTAT, is not an extension of
GACS Core, and nobody will accept that it is an extension, but it has to be
part of GACS, because for the statistical applications -- commodity lists, and
other code lists -- at the moment, there is no... SDMX [1] doesn't work.  Why
not?  Because it is only syntax.  The semantics of SDMX are not defined.  
Because it's a level of vocabularies.  If we talk about GACS, we have to 
talk about something like this.  We cannot talk simply about the history of 
bibliographical databases.  And we cannot say then that the core is that which 
has been most used in bibliographical databases.  With this, I do not want to 
diminish the importance of this.  But I don't want to see this as Core and 
Extensions -- but we have different parts.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDMX

__Brandon__: So profiles.  GACS profiles, which are useful for different use 
cases.  What do you want to use it for?  Then use this profile, which is tuned 
to your specific needs, hopefully.  Which eliminates the landmine of "extension" 
for you.

__Johannes__: Modules, elements, profiles...  I don't see any problem that an 
ontology uses concepts from different namespaces.  I think this anyway happens 
all the time.  You can also define a new namespace, and you have to make sure 
you are mapping to other namespaces that are using the concepts, but you can 
also mix namespaces.  So maybe we come in the end... _I'm_ coming to the idea 
that what is called the GACS Core is a kind of upper-level concept scheme that 
is useful for a generic description of agricultural publications, but very generic, 
which is not enough for specific descriptions, not enough for working, not enough 
for database compatibility, and interoperability, but it's a very important upper 
concept scheme, that is generally useful, and links to the specific vocabularies
that need to be in GACS.  If we then call this GACS, or something else, I don't 
care.  

__Tom__: I don't want to get too hung up on this work "extension".  I really 
see it as a way to talk about the governance issue.  So you could have something 
called GACS LandVoc or it could even just be called LandVoc -- doesn't need to 
be called GACS -- and it could consist entirely of terms from GACS, some of which 
would be from this more highly curated part called GACS Core, and some of which 
would be put there by Land Portal Foundation.

__Caterina__: Everything is highly curated.

__Johannes__: The commodities are highly curated.

__Osma__: Not by the same people.

__Tom__: I don't want to imply that it would not be highly curated.

__Caterina__: But that's important because if you want to have a coherent 
initiative that allows different people to link together data... these are the 
things that are very important.  

__Tom__: I do think there is value to the notion of having a center to this 
large... because it could grow out in alot of different directions, and that's 
fine, but having part which tries to be high-level, not just for bibliographical 
indexing -- I'm not convinced... the concepts needed for more data-oriented 
scenarios might be very much compatible with GACS Core.  GACS Core does not 
have to limit itself to things coming from the thesaurus.  It can evolve over 
time.  The current GACS Core that we have is a starting point.  As I picture it, 
it could evolve in different ways. But it would try to focus as a high-level 
center for this namespace that would be sprawling out in all directions.

__Dean__: I'd like to outline the modular structure of FIBO.  I'm not suggesting 
that GACS take a leaf out of FIBO's book, by any means, but there might be a 
few ideas there that might solve this.  For example, we have never used the 
word "core".  And we have never fought over it.  And I'm thinking: why is it 
that we are fighting over a core here?  We do have a module called Foundations,
and I'd like to talk about how it fits in with the other modules.  Maybe ten 
minutes.

__Tom__: We have a comment here from Lori, saying "our data people use NALT 
for metadata description".

__Johannes__: I didn't want to say it's not possible for data description.  
I said it's high-level.  If you treat database as a publication, then you can 
use GACS Core upper level.  But if you want to make the tables of the databases
interoperable, they are not, because if it is about "cows", you give the concept 
"cow" to all of them.  But if you want to make the databases compatible, you 
might need a list of 27 cow races, and of milking machine types, of other things 
that are necessary.  It's catering to different purposes.  If you only are on 
the level of publications, especially non-scientific publications, then I think 
the 15,000 concepts, as Simon Cox told us, are just wonderful.  And if you 
blow it up, it might not even be good, no?  But if you want to have working 
interoperability, this is another issue.  And this is not an issue between 
core and extensions but between different use cases. 

__Tom__: There is also an issue of granularity.

__Johannes__: Sure.

__Brandon__: Would it make sense to flip this over slightly? Just given 
what we have talked about yesterday and today.  I'm wondering if, thinking 
about the notion of GACS, instead of having a richer semantics, having a 
weaker semantics.  So where it's literally like a glossary of controlled 
natural language, in the literal sense of the word.  You have term sets.
And we have the natural-language descriptions.  And then there will be 
many definitions, so we'll have a natural-language description that is from 
agriculture. One that is from [boo-laak], or something like that.  And 
that essentially defines your [bins], right?  Which gets back to what I 
think Tom is talking about, where your definition describes where you sit 
in the hierarchy.  I'm wondering if that is something that would provide 
more value.

__Caterina__: Be careful with definitions from several domains, because it soon
won't be really reusable, that concept.  Because the implications might be
different.  So we should be careful to identify concepts that are as
unambiguous as possible from the start.  Like a list of crops, livestock...
because when you start putting too many definitions that imply contexts...  I'm
not saying it's either or.  We can also think of a constellation of resources
when you need to build an ontology that needs to refer to a specific entity,
then: "this is the vocabulary, set of concepts".  If you are in a document
indexing sort of setup, you can use the thesaurus vocabulary.  They should not
exclude each other.  

__Brandon__: So you'd want to cite the source for a definition, so when a human
goes in and looks at it, can decide not to use it because they are using in a
different fashion.  But then the terms all mean something specific, like if we
were to look at a glossary or dictionary.  And then the notion of an extension,
or profile, is then what other people build them to do.  So if I wanted build
an ontology around those terms, that core set of terms in GACS, I can build
that ontology, I can organize them in different ways, for my application, or
for the portal I am building, or whatever, but if anyone else wants to use it 
they know what all those terms mean, because they are defined in a shared 
manner.

__Dean__: This gets to a topic we had in the room across the way this morning.
You heard me let out a little bit of a yelp when I heard that only some small 
percentage of terms in GACS actually have written-out definitions, whereas 
on my side, must have a definition, and list of citable sources is actually 
pretty small.  If you point to Wikipedia -- big bone of contention -- "sorry, 
Wikipedia doesn't count".  It's too fluid.  You point to it, it changes, and 
you're still pointing.  Barron's Law Dictionary.  InvestoPedia.  Things like 
that.  I'm not sure how I see how it fits into the extension discussion that 
we're talking about.  This strikes me as good policy.

__Caterina__: Once you start thinking like this, there is no notion of core, 
extension.

__Brandon__: The core is just the term set that the people in GACS have agreed, 
and that's it, and you eliminate agreement on restrictions -- I can take it and 
use the terminology, build an ontology, and use it for a different purpose, for 
my use case, which may not fit anybody else's.

__Dean__: But it does.  I'm thinking of the LandVoc situation.  She has taken 
some terms, adds some stuff to it.  The governance question is how does she 
offer this for re-use?  That under the GACS auspices.

__Brandon__: That, to me, now we're in Agrisemantics.  So GACS is the list of 
terms and if we want to switch gears, build an ontology for re-use, you're using 
the GACS terminology and that's where GACS checks out.  Then it becomes -- for 
me -- Agrisemantics, that broader umbrella that these things all sit in.

__Dean__: If you pass it to Agrisemantics, that's fine: they're in the room too,
inasmuch as they exist.  The problem I see you having: you could simply take 
your vocabulary, which had 270 terms, 98 of which were in GACS, and you just 
publish it again: fine, that's great.  But your issue, as I understand it, is 
that Land Portal would like to use the infrastructure of GACS to publicize 
your vocabulary -- there are parallels to FIBO -- that's where I see your use case.
That's where we get into the governance thing.  Is there a GACS Board which says 
yes or no to you; when do they say yes or no; if they say yes before you start 
developing, well you might not even know you need that.  Do you change your 
namespace when...?  These are the things that I worry about.  While I like what 
you're saying, I don't see that it answers any of these questions.  I don't have 
an answer to these questions either.

__Brandon__: I also view it as a utility.  If there's a really good paper out
there, is it still really good if nobody cites or reads it?  So if you have a
really good vocabulary, ideally, it gets published and people know it's really
good because it gets re-used.  So if I go in and I want to use some resource, I
look through -- "that's crap, I'm not going to use it" -- I don't think that
how...

__Dean__: You said a magic word there: "published".  We're on the Web, so 
published doesn't mean anything, but if you think of GACS as a publisher --
the things she needs is actually what publishers used to provide.  They used 
to provide the way that something gets out there.  And that's actually the 
missing character in this play.  Is GACS going to play the role of publisher?
They don't seem to have signed up for that.

__Elizabeth__: If you decide to develop your ontology on land use, you could 
publish it everywhere.  There are plenty of portals.  So what would be the advantage 
of publishing it into GACS?  If GACS is a publisher, what would be the comparative 
advantage to other community portals and ontology repositories?  What would be 
the added the value?  

__Caterina__: GACS shouldn't be a portal.

__Elizabeth__: At the moment, if you look at the NCBO, or AgroPortal, we have 
ontologies published side-by-side.  But is GACS ambitioning to provide more -- 
a thesaurus, with some basic relationships?  Need to articulate the added value 
for republishing an existing vocabulary into GACS compared to, say, AgroPortal.

__Lisette__: For us, it would be that the linkages would all be other
agricultural vocabularies, that's really strong, that we could never get from
our land community.  The continuous updating and enrichment of these agriculture 
terms that are land-related.  So we're linked to that, and they can get our 
expertise specifically on a smaller subject, land, which we continue updating, helping 
each other -- that's the added value that we see from being involved.

__Tom__: I have a comment from Lori: the data people use NALT and they understand 
that our representative thesauri have more specificity than GACS, and that is probably 
why they use it and find it accommodating.  They also have needs for terms that we 
did not have, but then we add them.
