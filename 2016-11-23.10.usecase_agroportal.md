Anne Toulet presents AgroPortal [@@@]

__Anne__: AgroPortal -- ontology repository dedicated to agronomic domain. 
We offer different services, search. Five guiding use cases: 
1. IBC Rice Genomics & AgroLD project
   * data integration and knowledge management related to rice
   * RDF data integrated from a variety of plant resources and ontologies
2. RDA Wheat Data Interoperability working group
   * common framework for describing, representing, linking and publishing wheat
     data with respect to open standards
3. INRA Linked Open Vocabularies, LovInra
   * publish vocabularies produced or co-produced by INRA scientists and foster their
     reuse beyond the original researchers
   * Esther Dzalé-Yeumo & Sophie Aubin
4. Crop Ontology project
   * publishes ontologies required for describing crop germplasm, traits and
     evaluation trials
   * Elizabeth Arnaud & Marie-Angélique Laporte
5. GODAN global map of agri-food data standards
   * http://vest.agrisemantics.org
   * Valeria Pesce

__Anne__: Why GACS?  If we can have GACS in the AgroPortal, we can use it to
annotate text.  Users can add mappings manually, so it would be interesting to
propose mappings with GACS.  Technical problems to using AGROVOC, NALT, and
CABT; we are trying to solving.  

__Johannes__: Are they too big?

__Anne__: Not sure that's the only reason.  It's format.  Because the portal we
have is from the NCBO Bioportal -- it's the same technology -- and only made to
have SKOS terminologies.

__Dean__: You are doing two kinds of mappings: automatic, and by hand.  And you're 
mapping from where to where?  

__Anne__: Between ontologies in bioportal.  The mapping is a service to the users.
We can give them back the annotations and the mappings.  

__Sophie__: The mappings are published in.

__Dean__: Then your users can use this to transform datasets, do indices, whatnot.

__Anne__: Yes.

__Johannes__: AgroPortal is a publishing system, not editing -- you cannot edit them 
there.  Still correct?

__Anne__: Yes, it is not an editor tool.  Just publishing and offer services.  

__Brandon__: Also issues with versioning?

__Anne__: Yes.  Like NCBO BioPortal, but just for agronomy.  

__Johannes__: This is an important use case.  In my thinking, we have just two 
elements at the moment.  We talk about practicalities.  We have AgroPortal -- 
and all the ontologies we are producing we can put there -- and we have the 
editing environmental for GACS, where we can produce bricks and pieces that 
can be reused.  We need to plan.  We need a blueprint.  But we have something we 
can work on.  I would go, without any problem, with a proposal to make AgroPortal 
better -- business plan, more sustainable, investment to be more usable, etc.
As I could go with a project on GACS -- the editing environment, on enhancing, 
what maybe we will call not Core but upper...

__Brandon__: Foundations.

__Johannes__: Not even.  Foundations has the same problem as Core.  If we add 
elements that are not there at the moment, it could become something like a 
foundation.  Because foundation could be an upper layer of global generic 
concepts in agriculture, which most probably should not grow, and then 
foundations would need some more things: foundations for our data management. 
And then we need to plan how this relates to AgroPortal.  But we would have 
two streams that we could promote, work on, it's not that we have to wait 
for the perfect plan.  [AgroPortal] is as advanced as GACS.  We never thought 
that we would arrive to something usable in the phase that we concluded, 
because we had no funding.  We did this completely with in-kind funding and 
funding from regular money from the participating organizations.  We had no, 
not even the ambition, that we come to something that is usable.  But it is!
AgroPortal is a research project in the end, but it is something usable. 
So we have done, with very little input, alot -- this we can bring forward -- 
also if we show donors that we are able to do something that is usable. 

__Tom__: It's five o'clock.  We can continue over a beer.
